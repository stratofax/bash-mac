Bash scripts for setting up and maintaining your Mac

# Why bash?

You may not use the bash shell on your Mac when you go to the command line -- I prefer fish, and since macOS Catalina, the default shell is zsh. Still, bash is installed on every Mac that runs OS X. As a result, these scripts will run on most every Mac. 

Because of this, I won't use bash commands that aren't available on the standard Mac installation of bash.

# The scripts

An overview of the scripts: what they do, why you'd want to use them.

## macup.sh -- update your Mac

This script uses Apple's softwareupdate tool, and [Homebrew, The Missing Package Manager for macOS](https://brew.sh/)
